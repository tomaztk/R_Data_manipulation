# Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#     highlight-style: github
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

### Running Code in R

Here with using R Language.

```{r}
iris <- iris
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

iris %>%
  select ('Petal.Width', 'Petal.Length') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Petal.Length,y=Petal.Width))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

```

### Running Code in Py

And here is to use with Python:

```{python}
a = 1
```

And overall it is irrelevant the origin of language.
