```{r}
#| label: r-chunk-name
# a code chunk
```


# The code chunks you need to know:
  
## eval: true/false Do you want to evaluate the code?
## echo: true/false Do you want to print the code?
## cache: true / false Do you want to save the output of the chunk so it doesnâ€™t have to run next time?
## include: Do you want to include code output in the final output document? Setting to false means nothing is put into the output document, but the code is still run.

```{r}
#| label: read-iris
#| eval: false
iris_data <- iris
```

# Using inline code
# Code is executed
```{r}
kg_tk <- c(91, 90, 91, 90.5, 89.5, 91.2, 90.7)
kg_mean <- mean(r_heights)
```

# Code is used in print 
The mean of my kilos in 2025 is `{r} kg_mean`
